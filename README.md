# HW1_Code_Refactor
Below is my workflow for HW1 outlining my process step by step:
- I created a local repository and added it to github (GH)
- Created this readme.md
- Copied the HTML file - added to GH to make sure everything was working
- Copied "assets" into the folder / troubleshot naming conventions until the page functioned correctly
